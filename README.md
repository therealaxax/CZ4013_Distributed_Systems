# CZ4013_Distributed_Systems
<p> CZ4013_Distributed_Systems contains our Java code implementing the server and client programs for our distributed flight information system. The design of our request and reply message structures for use in our marshalling and unmarshalling functions, as well as our simulation of at-least-once and at-most-once invocation semantics on idempotent and non-idempotent operations, is explained in our project report. </p>
